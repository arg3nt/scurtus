      <h1>Scurtus Shortlink Service</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my cool shortlink service! Is it still a little jank? Perhaps. Did I make it in two nights? Also perhaps. Coming soon: server-side redirection! Are you still reading this? Sounds like something is either running slowly or the shortlink in question doesn't exist yet. Please contact nac@chera.xyz if you see unexpected behavior!</p>
